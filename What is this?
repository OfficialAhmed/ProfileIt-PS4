Its an automating tool that does alot in seconds to change PS4 profile icons with ease
With my tool ProfileIt

You no longer need to convert, resize, nor uploading all 5 images to your system
That means you don't have to check the user code of your desired account exp[1xACCxxx] 
it will convert the code into your actual account name.

Though this only works with FTP you must run FTP payload on the PS4 system.
